# Heater-control-system
This project monitors temperature using the DHT22 sensor and controls a heater (LED) and buzzer based on the temperature readings.

## Components Used
- Arduino Uno
- DHT22 Temperature Sensor
- LED (Heater Indicator)
- Buzzer (Overheat Alarm)
- Resistors
- Jumper wires

## Working Principle
- If temperature < 40°C → Heater (LED) turns ON.
- If temperature > 50°C → Buzzer turns ON.
- If temperature is between 40°C and 50°C → System is stabilizing (everything OFF).
